When asked what keeps them coming back, some said the concerts, some said the cosplay, many said the fact that itâ€™s a twenty-four hour show where you could play video games at 4 in the morning. A lot of people come with their friends every year. Some have moved away and still travel back every year for the festival.</div>
        <div className="main-text">Clearly MAGFest is a special event and an important community for many. At Uplift we understand the power of communities and work with organizers like MAGFest to ensure that these important communities are safe for everyone. With this in mind, we conducted a survey of MAGFest 2018 attendees on safety and inclusion.</div>
