		        <h4>Sahitya Raja</h4>
		        <p>Co-founder and Co-Executive Director</p>
		        <p>Sahitya Raja is a co-director and co-founder of Uplift- Online Communities Against Sexual Violence. She holds a bachelor’s in biological sciences, minored in gender studies with a focus in health and bioethics, and is currently pursuing a master’s degree in immunology. Sahitya sees sexual violence as a public health issue, and is obsessed with learning how our online interactions affect us, and how we can use the power of online communities to drive social change. She has been involved in the YouTube and Nerdfighter communities since 2009, and attended Leakycon in 2012 and 2014. In a proposal in March of 2014, Sahitya outlined Uplift’s mission and brought together the first few members of the team. She drinks an alarming amount of tea and still can’t quite cope with the fact that Parks and Rec is over.</p>

		        <h4>Katie Twyman</h4>
		        <p>Co-founder and Co-Executive Director</p>
		        <p>Katie Twyman has a love for online communities that stretches all the way back to 2008, when she found herself writing Harry Potter fan fiction with a handful of other nerd-types. In addition to giving her some of her dearest friends, the online world also sparked in her a passion for activism. Previously, she has volunteered with the Harry Potter Alliance, leading a campaign on climate change and serving on their chapters team. She has also volunteered for the Project for Awesome, an annual fundraising marathon that takes place entirely online. Katie began working with Uplift in 2014, using her background in the online world to help direct the group’s efforts. Never the type to do anything halfway, she quickly had her hands in nearly everything Uplift was working on. Katie spends her time offline working on her novel, snuggling with her rabbit, and ranting about how underrated a character Hagrid is in the Harry Potter series.</p>

		        <p>Co-founder and Operations Director</p>
		        <p>Grace Miller graduated from Brown University with a concentration in sociology. She is passionate about anti-sexual violence work, having been the Prevention and Education Intern for the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center and a hospital advocate providing emotional support and resources to victims of sexual assault in the ER. Grace cares deeply about the power of online sex education. She worked as the Social Media and Website Intern for the Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health, providing adults with a safe space to learn about sexuality issues. Grace has been enthusiastically involved in the YouTube community for seven years now, attending VidCon in 2012 and LeakyCon in 2011 and 2014. She has always spent copious amounts of time on the internet. She will gladly go on for hours on the importance of online communities and what the creation of these networks means for our society.</p>

		        <h4>Jennifer Dorsey</h4>
		        <p>Communications Director</p>
		        <p>Jennifer Dorsey is a digital media professional working in the Washington, DC area. She has a bachelor’s degree in political science, a certificate in women and politics, and a master’s degree in public communication. While in college she became heavily involved in women’s issues, including leading the annual Take Back the Night march and Clothesline Project. Following college, she dove head first into online fan communities, particularly the Harry Potter world, and began using her passion for good. She previously volunteered for the Harry Potter Alliance, helping them to communicate their unique mission to the world. Her goal now is to get as many people as possible to hear, see, and understand the power behind Uplift. When not trying to save the world through her keyboard, she can often be found writing about broadway and other nerdy things at GeekyNews, attempting to re-write her first novel for the twentieth time, or auditioning for community theater productions of her favorite musicals.
